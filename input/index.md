A play-on-demand animation system for Unity by [Mathieu Philippe](https://www.moartis.dev).

While working on a game prototype featuring different type of ranged and melee weapons, I grew tired of fighting with an evergrowing and overly complex [animator controller](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/class-AnimatorController.html). Although being great for the use-cases it was designed for, I needed to be able to easily transition from one animation set to another by script.

Thus I started to develop my own animation system using Unity's [Playables](https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/Playables.Playable.html). After many months of using and polishing it, I decided to try releasing FlexMotion as my first commercial tool.
